### Directory Contents
- /generated_pln  
Saved .pln files generated by the exoplanet_gui are automatically stored here.  These files do not include some final tweaks, such as removing any "et al" references and resetting certain parameters that will be calculated by the reconciler code.  
- *Exoplanet.py*  
This contains two classes (ExoParameter and Exoplanet) used to construct a .pln file as used by exoplanets.org.  An ExoParameter object captures information related to a single exoplanet parameter, such as value, uncertainty values, default value, source, corresponding fields in other databases, etc.  An Exoplanet object consists primarily of a number of ExoParameter objects associated with attributes, with a number of functions to read and write this information to/from various sources.  
- *aug03_finished_pln.zip*  
A zipped set of finalized .pln files from 2018 Aug 03.  
- *exoparam_template.yaml*  
The Exoplanet class uses this file to construct ExoParameter objects replicating a default exoplanet on exoplanets.org.  By using this template, an empty Exoplanet() object will essentially replicate the blank .pln template file.  
- *exoplanet_gui.py*  
A quick PyQt GUI that uses the Exoplanet class to read and write .pln files.  This allows for much faster .pln creation and editing, with built-in Exoplanet class file verification.  
- *exoplanet_tables.db*  
A SQLite database file containing the results of the steps and code contained in the Python Notebook.
- *exoplanets_org_work.ipynb*  
A Python Notebook with steps taken and code written to identify a list of confirmed exoplanets listed in both exoplanet.eu and the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
- *new_exoplanets_to_add.csv*  
A CSV file containing just the final resulting table from the Python Notebook.  This table is also contained in the SQLite database file.
- *pln_template.yaml*  
A YAML template file to help the Exoplanet class recreate a pln file with the original sections and parameters.  
- *skip_planets.txt*  
A list of planet names to omit from EOD.  
  
### Workflow
1.  We started by comparing confirmed exoplanets in both the [Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia](http://exoplanet.eu) and the [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html) with the current contents of exoplanets.org.  This resulted in a list of 366 exoplanets to add.  This work is documented in *exoplanets_org_work.ipynb*.  
2.  We then used the Exoplanet class in *Exoplanet.py* and the data already retrieved for these missing exoplanets to generate .pln files for all 366 exoplanets with pre-loaded parameters.  
3.  It was then a matter of navigating to the source materials to confirm and refine the entered parameters, and add any missing information, before generating a finalized .pln file to be run through the IDL reconciler code.  
4.  Microlensing targets in the list were skipped, and some updates to older planets and new planets around previously-known hosts were added, resulting in a set of 347 .pln files, each of which was manually updated to varying extents.  
5.  These files will need to be processed through the IDL reconciler code and then pushed to the exoplanets.org data Github repo before they are visible on the live site.  
  
### Next Steps
- It will be important to rewrite the IDL reconciler code in Python.  This will allow wider access to .pln file processing, potential revisions to accepted file structures (such as a more formal YAML formatting), and some itegration of additional finalization and calculation steps.  
- We will also need a clear plan for keeping exoplanets.org updated going forward, and a better way to keep track of data curation decisions by multiple contributors.
